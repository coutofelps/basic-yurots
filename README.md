#  Original Open Tibia Yurots

An original open Tibia server thought to be a 8.6 base version and server build.

## Getting Started

An open Tibia server project based on Yurots 1.2, made by Yures. The objective of this project is fix all finded bugs, compile new (and best, clean and fast) sources, remove all map bugs, improve the map and add a website in the near future.

### Installing

* First, you need to set up a MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite server and create a database with schema included at the project;
* After that, you need to configure the config.lua file with the name of this database and what more you want;
* Now, you need to download the compiled sources for a Tibia 8.6 client version and voil√†! The server is running!
